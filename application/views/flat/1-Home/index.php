                <p><em>Seeded by a grant from Sri D P Santhanam Endowment Fund</em></p>
                <p>Advaita literature is vast, well studied, has continuous stream of contributions and has a well documented grantha paramapara - hierarchy of texts. The aim of the project is to present this immense intellectual treasure in the form of a genealogy tree on the Internet canvass with extensive hyperlinks and details of the authors and their works. A magnificent work by Vidwan R. Thangaswamy, `Bibiliographical Survey Of Advaita Vedanta', published by the University of Madras in 1980 inspires this project which would capture his work in a form designed to facilitate further research in this field. Therefore this project is of immense value to students / researchers of Vedanta and is certain to have a very large number of visits.</p>
